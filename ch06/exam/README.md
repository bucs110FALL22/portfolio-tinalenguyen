# CS110 Midterm Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*

I built a program that draws a freshly shaven happy Bob Ross. A lot of my functions rely on set restraints and given coordinates as inputs.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
Nope.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*
Python Turtle Documentation[https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#turtle.pos] 

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*

If you were to call the functions using different values, it would take a lot of math to make it look like the image I set up originally (figuring out constraints) but otherwise it should be somewhat simple to change.
